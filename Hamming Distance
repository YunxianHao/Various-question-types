//The Hamming distance between two integers refers to the number of different positions of these two numbers corresponding to binary bits.
//Give you two integers x and y, calculate and return the Hamming distance between them.
Code:
int hammingDistance(int x, int y){
    int dif = 0;
    int xor = x^y;
    while(xor)
    {
        dif += xor&1;
        xor>>=1;
    }   
    return dif;
}
